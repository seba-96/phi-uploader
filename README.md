## Typical 422 Error Responses

A 422 status code means the request was well-formed but contained semantic errors. Some common examples include:

- **{"error": "Remote has already been taken"}**  
  Indicates that the patient has been already uploaded.

- **{"errors": ["Missing patient for <participant_id>"]}**  
  Indicates that the patient related to the given acquisition has been not yet uploaded. First upload the patient, then the acquisition.

- **{"acquisition_type": ["has already been taken"]}**  
  Indicates that the acquisition provided for the given patient has been already uploaded. Each patient can have only one acquisition of each type.
